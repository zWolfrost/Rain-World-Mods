# zWolfrost's Rain World Mods
This repository contains various mods I made for Rain World. Most of them are going to be experimental and may not be fully polished. Here be dragons.

## Centiwing
Adds a new playable character, the Centiwing, which can glide and stun enemies. Plays during the Spearmaster timeline.
